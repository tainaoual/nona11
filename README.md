## Deadline and Grading Criteria
The deadline for this project is Monday, September 14th, at 9:30am.
If the project is not complete or not pushed up to GitHub at that time it will be evaluated as an _Incomplete_ project.

This is a Pass/Fail assignment, the assignment will be considered passing if it meets the following criteria:
- Uses Git and GitHub to push complete assignment to GitHub before due date.
- The code compiles.  (No red squiggly underlines!)
- 7 of 8 methods meet the requirements as described in the comments above the method.  This will be verified with the provided unit tests.

If your project doesn't meet these criteria at the deadline, it will be marked as _Needs Improvement_.

If your project is evaluated as _Incomplete_ or _Needs Improvement_ we will let you know and give you feed back on what needs to change to help move it to a passing project.
You will receive a new deadline of Friday, September 18th, at 9:30 to re-submit your project by pushing changes to GitHub.  
We will evaluate the project one more time and record this as the final grade for this project with _Incompletes_ and _Needs Improvements_ being set to _Fail_ on the _Pass/Fail_ scale.
